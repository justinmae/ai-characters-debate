    "description": "I (f20) am engaged to my fiance (m26) and we’ve been together for 2 years. He’s never ever done something like this before so I guess this is why I’m so scared- I just don’t know. He’s so usually so kind. I feel violated, if I’m allowed to say that. It was two nights ago, and I haven’t left my bed since. Basically we were in his bed in his home and we were going to sleep.

I’ve told her it bothers me but she really just doesn’t show any type of care about my own feelings. Last weekend, we went to a party at her friend's place. It was a chill night with a big group of our friends. But then, she had a few drinks and started “joking” or just started completely flaming me. She joked about how..."
