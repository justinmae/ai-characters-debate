"I feel violated and confused by what my fiancé did to me. WIBTAH if I told my parents?","I (f20) am engaged to my fiance (m26) and we’ve been together for 2 years. He’s never ever done something like this before so I guess this is why I’m so scared- I just don’t know. He’s so usually so kind. I feel violated, if I’m allowed to say that. It was two nights ago, and I haven’t left my bed since. Basically we were in his bed in his home and we were going to sleep. For info, my fiancé and I have never slept together before and we don’t do anything like that because I am supposed to be sav..."

"AIO After Leaving a Party After My GF Was Making Fun of Me? (Messages the morning after the party)","I (27M) have been with my girlfriend (25F) for two years. At first, her jokes were fun. But lately, they seem to be more about making me look bad, especially in front of friends. I’ve told her it bothers me but she really just doesn’t show any type of care about my own feelings. Last weekend, we went to a party at her friend's place. It was a chill night with a big group of our friends. But then, she had a few drinks and started “joking” or just started completely flaming me. She joked about how..."

"Doctor accused me of being an overweight alcoholic","I went for my yearly checkup, post labs so that the blood work has already come in.

I answered ""Most days none, I have probably 3-4 drinks a month if that"". Later the doctor comes in and says my blood work looks pretty much ideal but she had real concerns that I was a borderline alcoholic and that it would lead to health complications very soon. Me: ""Excus..."
